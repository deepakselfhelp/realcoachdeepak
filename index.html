      <h2>Meet Deepak</h2>
      <p>
        Manish Singh, also known as Deepak, is an Indian-born international confidence and social skills coach 
        who helps people live their fullest lives free from anxiety and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has supported thousands of individuals in overcoming anxiety and improving their social skills, 
        particularly in personal and professional interactions. Deepak has empowered many men and women 
        to lead more confident lives. His teachings have transformed careers and businesses, 
        enabling people to reach their full potential after mastering social skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deepak's own journey was far from easy. He migrated to Europe at a young age and struggled deeply 
        with social anxiety. Even something as simple as going to a grocery store felt like going to war. 
        But over time, step by step, he transformed himself—and today, he is dedicated to helping countless 
        others build confidence and thrive socially.

        <h2>Why Confidence is the Key to a Fulfilling Life</h2>
        <p>
          Every opportunity, connection, and relationship you dream of begins
          with the way you see yourself.  
          Confidence isn’t arrogance — it’s alignment between who you are and how you show up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most men spend years over-thinking and under-acting, trapped in loops of fear.
          Deepak’s approach cuts through that noise and builds the mindset, body language,
          and emotional control that real confidence demands.

        <h2>My Journey — From Silent to Self-Made</h2>
        <p>
          Years ago, I struggled with the same fear most men face — social rejection,
          overthinking, and self-doubt. I was quiet, invisible, and constantly seeking approval.
          Through relentless self-work, trial and error, and mastering social dynamics,
          I transformed myself completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I coach students from more than 30 countries. My goal is simple — to help men
          find the same freedom and confidence that changed my life forever.
